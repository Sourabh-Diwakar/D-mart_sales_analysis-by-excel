# D-mart_sales_analysis-by-excel

## Overview

This project analyzes **DMart sales data from 2014-2017**, focusing on **sales, profit, and category trends** across different segments, shipping modes, and regions to generate actionable business insights.

The dataset contains:
- Customer, Order, Product, and Shipping details
- Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit
- Temporal dimensions (Year, Month, Day)

Using these, I created an **Excel Dashboard for dynamic filtering and trend analysis** to support business decisions effectively.
